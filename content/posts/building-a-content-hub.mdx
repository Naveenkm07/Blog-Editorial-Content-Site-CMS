## A small, useful structure

Start with a clear set of content types:

- Posts
- Categories
- Tags
- Authors

## Consistency beats complexity

Keep naming and URL patterns predictable. This makes the site easier to navigate and easier to maintain.

## Next steps

Replace these placeholders with your own editorial guidelines.
