## Treat your Post shape as a contract

Decide the fields your UI needs (title, excerpt, author, tags) and keep them stable.

## Normalize early

Convert CMS responses into your local `Post` model in one place. Don’t leak provider details into pages.

## Keep slugs boring

Stable slugs prevent broken links. Prefer readable phrases over campaign-style strings.
