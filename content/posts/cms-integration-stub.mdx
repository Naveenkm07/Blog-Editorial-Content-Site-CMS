## Why this exists

This project includes a CMS-ready structure. The data layer can be swapped from local MDX to a headless CMS.

## Where to wire it

- A CMS client (Sanity or Strapi)
- A mapping layer that returns the same `Post` shape
- Optional preview/draft support

## Keep it stable

Try to keep routing and page components independent from the data provider.
