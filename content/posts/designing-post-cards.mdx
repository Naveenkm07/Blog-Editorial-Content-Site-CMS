## Lead with the title

A strong title is the primary tap target. Keep it readable, not clever.

## Keep metadata consistent

Show author and date in the same place on every card. Consistency lowers cognitive load.

## Let whitespace do the work

Use generous spacing and avoid adding more than two tags on the card face.
