## Write the snippet like a promise

A meta description should tell the reader what they’ll get, not repeat the headline.

## Use structured data for clarity

JSON-LD helps search engines interpret your page. It should match the visible content.

## Avoid busywork

If you can’t measure the impact, keep it minimal and move on.
