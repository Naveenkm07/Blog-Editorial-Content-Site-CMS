## Start with a theme, not a backlog

Pick one theme for the month. Write three posts that answer one reader question from different angles.

## Use three states

- Draft
- Ready
- Published

If you need more than that, you likely need clearer roles, not more columns.

## Protect your “next post” slot

Always keep one post small and shippable. It keeps momentum when larger pieces slip.
